            <h1>Combinatorial games are two-person games with perfect information and no chance moves (no randomization like coin toss is involved that can effect the game). These games have a win-or-lose or tie outcome and determined by a set of positions, including an initial position, and the player whose turn it is to move. Play moves from one position to another, with the players usually alternating moves, until a terminal position is reached. A terminal position is one from which no moves are possible. Then one of the players is declared the winner and the other the loser. Or there is a tie (Depending on the rules of the combinatorial game, the game could end up in a tie. The only thing that can be stated about the combinatorial game is that the game should end at some point and should not be stuck in a loop. In order to prevent such looping situations in games like chess(consider the case of both the players just moving their queens to-and-fro from one place to the other), there is actually a “50-move rule” according to which the game is considered to be drawn if the last 50 moves by each player have been completed without the movement of any pawn and without any capture.

                On the other hand, Game theory in general includes games of chance, games of imperfect knowledge, and games in which players can move simultaneously.

                The specialty of Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT) is that the coding part is relatively very small and easy. The key to the Game Theory problems is that hidden observation, which can be sometimes very hard to find.

                Chess, Game of Nim, Tic-Tac-Toe all comes under the category of Combinatorial Game Theory. </h1>
